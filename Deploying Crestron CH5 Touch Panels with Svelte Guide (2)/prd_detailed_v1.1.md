# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Crestron CH5 Svelte Demo Panel

**Version:** 1.1

**Date:** May 14, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This section outlines the purpose, goals, audience, scope, and definitions related to the Crestron CH5 Svelte Demo Panel project.

### 1.1. Purpose of the Document

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a demonstration touch panel interface. The interface is designed for controlling a typical conference room audio-visual (AV) system and will be built using Svelte, leveraging the `ch5-svelte` library for communication with a Crestron control system, and incorporating UI components from libraries such as `shadcn/ui`. The purpose is to provide a clear understanding of the project's objectives, features, constraints, and deliverables for all stakeholders involved, including project managers, developers, and QA teams.

### 1.2. Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

*   **Comprehensive Demonstration:** To create a feature-rich demo panel that showcases a wide array of commonly used AV control components and their interactions, presented with a polished and modern UI.
*   **Svelte Implementation with Modern UI Components:** To build the Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Svelte framework (specifically Svelte 5 with Runes), incorporating components from `shadcn/ui` and potentially other suggested UI libraries to enhance visual appeal and development efficiency.
*   **Bidirectional Crestron Integration:** To ensure seamless and robust bidirectional communication with Crestron control systems, allowing for real-time control and feedback for analog, digital, and serial signals, strictly following the `ch5-svelte` integration patterns including contract file usage and Crestron Communication Library (`CrComLib`) / Web XPanel setup.
*   **Intuitive User Experience:** To design and develop a user interface that is highly intuitive and easy to use for non-technical end-users needing to control AV equipment within a conference room environment, supported by a well-defined style guide and theming.
*   **Adherence to Best Practices:** To follow the guidelines and best practices outlined in the `ch5-svelte` documentation for project setup, development, and deployment, and to establish a clear style guide and theming strategy early in the development process.

### 1.3. Target Audience (for the PRD)

This document is intended for the following audiences:

*   Project Manager
*   Development Team
*   QA Team
*   Stakeholders

### 1.4. Target End-User (for the Demo Panel)

### 1.5. Scope

This section defines the boundaries of the project.

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Design and development of the Svelte-based touch panel GUI, including all visual elements, navigation, and user interaction flows, utilizing `shadcn/ui` components as a primary UI library, with potential for incorporating other suitable component libraries as suggested by the development IDE (Manus).
    *   Integration with Crestron control system signals (analog, digital, and serial) using the `ch5-svelte` library for bidirectional communication, with strict adherence to contract file (`.cse2j`) usage for signal mapping.
    *   Implementation of control interfaces for a comprehensive set of AV components typically found in a conference room.
    *   Strict adherence to the setup, coding (including `CrComLib` and Web XPanel integration), and deployment procedures detailed in the `ch5-svelte` documentation.
    *   Creation of a demo panel that includes examples of all signal types and interaction patterns described in the `ch5-svelte` documentation.
    *   Establishment and documentation of a style guide and theming approach for the UI, with the development IDE (Manus) prompting for decisions on these aspects.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Crestron control system programming (e.g., SIMPL Windows, SIMPL# Pro, C# for VC-4).
    *   Physical hardware installation.
    *   Network infrastructure setup beyond basic assumptions.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1. Product Perspective

The Crestron CH5 Svelte Demo Panel is a software application designed to run on Crestron CH5-compatible touch panels. It serves as a sophisticated, user-friendly front-end interface to a backend Crestron control system, demonstrating the capabilities of Svelte combined with modern UI component libraries like `shadcn/ui` for CH5 development. The project emphasizes strict adherence to the `ch5-svelte` framework for Crestron integration, including the correct use of contract files, `CrComLib`, and Web XPanel for testing.

### 2.2. Product Features (High-Level)

*   Intuitive Touch-Based Control with a Polished UI (leveraging `shadcn/ui`).
*   Real-Time System Feedback.
*   Comprehensive AV Component Control.
*   Modern Web Technology Stack (Svelte 5, TypeScript, `shadcn/ui`).
*   Strict Bidirectional Signal Handling via `ch5-svelte` (using contracts, `CrComLib`, XPanel).
*   Example-Driven Design.
*   Defined Style Guide and Theming.

### 2.3. User Characteristics

*   Non-Technical Users.
*   Infrequent Users.
*   Task-Oriented.
*   Expectation of Simplicity, Responsiveness, and Modern Aesthetics.

### 2.4. Operating Environment

*   Hardware: Crestron CH5 compatible touch panel.
*   Control System: Crestron 3-Series/4-Series or VC-4 server.
*   Network: Stable TCP/IP network.
*   Software Dependencies: `@crestron/ch5-crcomlib`, `ch5-svelte`, `shadcn/ui`, Node.js, npm/yarn, Vite.

### 2.5. Design and Implementation Constraints

*   **Svelte 5 and `ch5-svelte` Core:** The GUI must be developed using Svelte 5 with Runes, and must utilize the `ch5-svelte` library for all Crestron signal interactions. This is a non-negotiable core technical requirement.
*   **Strict `ch5-svelte` Adherence:** All project setup, development practices (including contract file usage, `CrComLib` integration, and Web XPanel setup for testing), and deployment procedures must strictly follow the guidelines provided in the `ch5-svelte` documentation.
*   **Primary UI Component Library:** `shadcn/ui` will be the primary component library. The development IDE (Manus) may suggest other complementary libraries if deemed beneficial and compatible.
*   **Touch Interaction Focus.**
*   **TypeScript Usage.**
*   **Deployment via `ch5-cli`.**
*   **Style Guide and Theming Definition:** A clear style guide and theming strategy must be defined. The development IDE (Manus) will prompt for decisions regarding these aspects during the design and development phases.

### 2.6. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   Functional Crestron Control System with defined signals and contract file.
*   Network Infrastructure.
*   Availability of `ch5-cli`.
*   Developer Familiarity (Svelte, TypeScript, Crestron concepts, `shadcn/ui`).

## 6. Technical Implementation Details (from `ch5-svelte` README and Component Library Integration)

(This section needs to be updated to include `shadcn/ui` setup if specific steps are known for Svelte. If `shadcn/ui` for Svelte is a set of Svelte components, it might just be an `npm install` and import. If it requires Tailwind, those setup steps would be noted here.)

### 6.1. Project Setup (as before)

### 6.2. Dependency Installation (as before, add `shadcn/ui` and its dependencies e.g. Tailwind CSS if required)
    *   `ch5-svelte`
    *   `@crestron/ch5-crcomlib`
    *   `vite-plugin-static-copy`
    *   `shadcn-svelte` (or the equivalent package for Svelte, e.g., `bits-ui`, `radix-svelte` if `shadcn/ui` is used via these primitives) and its peer dependencies like `tailwindcss`.

### 6.3. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`) (as before, may need Tailwind CSS plugin if `shadcn/ui` uses it)

### 6.4. HTML Setup (`index.html`) (as before)

### 6.5. Contract File (`contract.cse2j`) (as before, emphasize mandatory usage)

### 6.6. Web XPanel Setup (as before, emphasize mandatory for dev/testing)

### 6.7. `shadcn/ui` (or equivalent Svelte components) Integration
    *   Follow installation instructions for `shadcn-svelte` or the chosen Svelte equivalent (e.g., installing `bits-ui`, `tailwind-variants`, `clsx`, `lucide-svelte`).
    *   Initialize Tailwind CSS if required by the component library: `npx tailwindcss init -p` and configure `tailwind.config.js` and `app.pcss` (or equivalent global CSS file).
    *   Components will be added to the project as needed using the `shadcn-svelte` CLI or by manually creating them based on library patterns.

### 6.8. Deployment to Touch Panel (as before)

### 6.9. SvelteKit Considerations (as before)

## 7. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements

(No significant changes, but theming is now a current requirement to be defined, not just future)

## 8. Glossary

(Add terms related to `shadcn/ui` or chosen Svelte component primitives if they become common, e.g., `Bits UI`, `Radix Svelte`)
