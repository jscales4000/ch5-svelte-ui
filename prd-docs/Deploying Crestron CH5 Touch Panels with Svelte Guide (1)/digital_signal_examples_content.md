# Digital Signal Examples | ch5-svelte

[]()

This is a collection of example uses of digital signals. Only basic HTML constructs are used, and no styling is provided. Pick your favorite CSS framework, and or Svelte component library and style it as you like.

## Simple Trigger Button (No Feedback)

    <script lang="ts">  import {pulseDigital} from 'ch5-svelte';</script><button onclick={() => pulseDigital("Toggle.Toggle")}>Push It!</button>
    

Pulse Digital sends a rising edge and then a falling edge to the specified signal.

## Toggle Button (With Feedback)

    <script lang="ts">  import {useDigital} from 'ch5-svelte';  const toggleButton = useDigital("Toggle.Out","Toggle.Toggle")</script><button style="background-color: {toggleButton.value ? 'green' : ''}" onclick={() => toggleButton.pulse()}>Toggle!</button>
    

Use Digital creates a digital signal object that can be used to read and write to the signal. The first argument is the signal to read (Feedback from control system), and the second argument is the signal to write (event to control system). The pulse method sends a rising edge and then a falling edge to the specified signal.

We can use the value property to read the current value of the signal. In this case, we use it to change the background color of the button. Since the value property uses a $state rune under the hood, the button will update automatically when the value changes.

## HTML Input Element (Checkbox with Feedback)

    <script lang="ts">  import {useDigital} from 'ch5-svelte';  const toggleButton = useDigital("Toggle.Out","Toggle.Toggle")</script><input type="checkbox" checked={toggleButton.value} onclick={() => toggleButton.pulse()} />
    

It may seem tempting to simply bind `toggleButton.value` to the `checked` attribute of the input element, but this will not work as expected. The checkbox handles the toggle internally, which means it will provide its expected state (held true or held false) back to `value`. This will work fine as long as the checkbox is shown on screen, but if the component the checkbox in is destroyed, the output signal will be driven to false regardless of the intended state.

This is why we use the `onclick` event to send a pulse to the signal, which will toggle the signal in the control system. The `Toggle.Toggle` signal is connected to the `clock` input of a `toggle` symbol, and `Toggle.out` is connected to the `out` of that same `toggle` symbol. This allows the state to be handled by the control system and ensures that the expected state of the toggle persists in the control system and is reflected in any other components (or UIs) that may be listening to the signal.

## Ramp Up/Down Button

    <script lang="ts">  import {useAnalog, useDigital} from 'ch5-svelte';  const level = useAnalog("ramp.levelF")  const up = useDigital("ramp.Up")  const down = useDigital("ramp.Down")</script><button   onpointerdown={() => up.value = true}  onpointerup={() => up.value = false}  onpointerout={() => up.value = false}  oncontextmenu={(e) => e.preventDefault()}  > Volume UP </button>  <p>Volume: {Math.round(level.value/655.35)}%</p><button   onpointerdown={() => down.value = true}  onpointerup={() => down.value = false}  onpointerout={() => down.value = false}  oncontextmenu={(e) => e.preventDefault()}  > Volume Down </button>
    

`useDigital` and `setDigital` both use the repeatDigital object to communicate when a button is held and to prevent the button from remaining in the pressed state if component is destroyed or the UI is disconnected from the control system. See the [Crestron Docs]() for more information on repeatDigital.

useDigital (or any other use functions), when provided with a single argument will use the same join for both feedback and control. In this case since we are only setting the value, we can pass the single set join and ignore the feedback portion of the signal.

Optionally you could also use the `setDigital` function to set the value of the signal. But it slightly less concise than `useDigital` and setting the value directly.

    <button   onpointerdown={() => setDigital("ramp.Up", true)}  onpointerup={() => setDigital("ramp.Up", false)}  onpointerout={() => setDigital("ramp.Up", false)}  oncontextmenu={(e) => e.preventDefault()}  > Volume UP </button>

It is important to listen to both the pointerup and pointerout events to ensure that the button is released when the pointer leaves the button. The oncontextmenu event is used to prevent the context menu from appearing when the button is held down on some touch devices.

## Using Digital Signals to Show/Hide Elements

    <script lang="ts">
      import {setDigital, useAnalog, useDigital} from 'ch5-svelte';
      const ShowPage = useDigital("Toggle.Out")
    </script>

    {#if ShowPage.value}
      <h1>Page is shown</h1>
    {:else}
      <h1>Page is hidden</h1>
    {/if}

Digital signals can be used to show and hide elements in the UI. Using the #if block, we can conditionally render elements based on the value of the digital signal. In this case, the page will be shown if the signal is true, and hidden if the signal is false.
